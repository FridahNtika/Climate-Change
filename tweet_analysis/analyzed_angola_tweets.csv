Foi com profunda tristeza que tomei conhecimento do falecimento do ex-Presidente da Organiza√ß√£o do Povo do Sudoeste Africano ‚Äì SWAPO e primeiro Presidente da Rep√∫blica da Nam√≠bia, Samuel Daniel Shafiishuna, mais conhecido como Sam Nujoma, ocorrido no dia 8 de fevereiro de 2025, aos 95 anos de idade.

Desde o in√≠cio da luta de liberta√ß√£o de Angola, alguns membros da UNITA e da SWAPO compartilharam trincheiras comuns na luta pela emancipa√ß√£o dos povos de √Åfrica.

Reconhecemos e agradecemos o apoio que a Organiza√ß√£o do Povo do Sudoeste Africano prestou aos Movimentos de Liberta√ß√£o da √Åfrica Austral, sob a lideran√ßa de Sam Nujoma, e honramos esta emblem√°tica figura pol√≠tica africana, cuja traject√≥ria iniciou-se com o activismo revolucion√°rio contra o regime do Apartheid, culminando com a sua ascens√£o ao estatuto de membro fundador e primeiro Presidente da Organiza√ß√£o do Povo do Sudoeste Africano ‚Äì SWAPO, conduzindo a Nam√≠bia √† independ√™ncia em 1990.

Para al√©m de liderar a luta pela independ√™ncia e governar o seu pa√≠s, Sam Nujoma introduziu reformas que hoje garantem alguma independ√™ncia aos poderes complementares do Estado. Conseguiu deixar o poder pol√≠tico, permanecer na sua p√°tria e viver uma vida simples no seio das suas comunidades, tornando-se um dos raros exemplos dos nossos tempos.

Curvo-me perante a mem√≥ria desta figura emblem√°tica da regi√£o Austral e do Continente Africano e endere√ßo, em nome da UNITA e em meu pr√≥prio, as mais profundas condol√™ncias √† fam√≠lia enlutada, √† SWAPO e ao Governo e Povo namibianos.

We recognize and appreciate the support that the South West Africa People's Organisation provided to the Liberation Movements of Southern Africa, under the leadership of Sam Nujoma, and we honor this emblematic African political figure, whose trajectory began with revolutionary activism against the Apartheid regime, culminating in his ascent to the status of founding member and first President of the South West Africa People's Organisation ‚Äì SWAPO, leading Namibia to independence in 1990. In addition to leading the struggle for independence and governing his country, Sam Nujoma introduced reforms that today guarantee some independence to the complementary powers of the State. He managed to leave political power, remain in his homeland, and live a simple life within his communities, becoming one of the rare examples of our times. I bow before the memory of this emblematic figure of the Southern region and the African Continent and extend, on behalf of UNITA and myself, the deepest condolences to the grieving family, to SWAPO, and to the Namibian Government and People.
